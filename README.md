## ‚≠ê Portfolio Application

### My summary
The purpose of this project is to build a portfolio web page to show my work experience and the stack of technologies that I have learned during the last couple of years. The technologies used are React, Typescript, css modules, Vite, React Router and Docker. Eslint and Prettier is always present to keep the code as clean as possible.
If you don't want to download the project locally, here you can see a quick overview of the portfolio.
